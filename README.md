## What is TDD (Test-driven Development)
- Definition: Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests for your production code before writing the actual code.
- Purpose: The main goal of TDD is to ensure software quality by ensuring tests are written and exist from the very beginning.
- Benefits: Writing tests first ensures that your codebase is well-tested and helps maintain robust and maintainable code.

## The advantages of TDD
- Clarifies Thinking: TDD forces you to clarify your understanding of the problem before writing production code, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and rework.
- Improves Communication: It provides a concrete way for team members to communicate their intentions through tests, which are more reliable than comments.
- Enhances Code Structure: Writing tests first often leads to better-structured and more modular code, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- Reduces Risk of Breakage: Tests allow developers to make changes confidently, knowing that the tests will catch any issues.
  
## The Disadvantages of TDD
- Time-Consuming: TDD initially takes more time than writing code without tests, but it can save time in the long run by preventing bugs.
- Management Buy-In: It can be challenging to get management on board with TDD, especially if they are not programmers and focus on short-term timelines.
- Risk of Bad Tests: Writing poor-quality tests can undermine the benefits of TDD and give a false sense of security.
